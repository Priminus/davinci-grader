# 2026-02-18 — Color Grade: iPhone 16 Apple Log

## Pipeline Built (7 nodes)
1. **CST-In** — Rec.2020/Apple Log → DaVinci Wide Gamut/DaVinci Intermediate
2. **CST-Out** — DaVinci Wide Gamut/DI → Rec.709/Rec.709-A
3. **Curves** — Gentle S-curve (3 control points: shadows slightly down, highlights slightly up)
4. **Primaries** — Contrast 1.030, Pivot 0.400, Tint -3, Gain G -0.01
5. **HDR** — Light Exp +0.03, Specular Exp -0.05
6. **Window** — Circle power window on subject (default size)
7. **Outside Node** — Background: Light Exp -0.08, Specular -0.10, Global -0.05

## Notes
- iPhone 16 footage confirmed in Apple Log (flat/desaturated raw)
- CST conversion works correctly — produces natural Rec.709 output
- Conservative adjustments to avoid color casts
- Power Window panel accessible at x=615, y=680 (not 530 as in AGENTS.md)
- Temp field in primaries is very sensitive — values like -200 cause severe color shifts; use single-digit values

## Issues Encountered
- Peekaboo coordinate system matches screenshot pixels (1728×1000)
- AI vision analysis sometimes reports coordinates at different scale (1327×768)
- First grading attempt had severe magenta cast from aggressive primaries (Temp=-200, heavy blue push)
- Rebuilt pipeline from scratch with minimal adjustments
