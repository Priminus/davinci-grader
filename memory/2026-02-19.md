## Bug: Curves points not created, drags didn't work (09:51)

### What happened
- Calculated curve point coordinates mathematically from hardcoded BL/TR coords
- Clicked all 5 positions in rapid succession without verifying ANY of them
- Then dragged from those same positions — but no points existed, so drags just moved the cursor
- User observed: no points on curve, cursor moved but nothing was dragged

### Root cause
- **Skipped verification entirely.** Did not use `peekaboo see --analyze` after:
  1. Opening the Curves tab (didn't confirm it was active)
  2. Clicking to create each point (didn't confirm points appeared)
  3. Dragging each point (didn't confirm curve shape changed)
- Violated the see → identify → act pattern from AGENTS.md
- Batched all clicks together without checking any intermediate state

### Fix applied
- Updated AGENTS.md with mandatory verification rules for curves AND all UI interactions
- Added rule: act → verify → proceed (or retry). NEVER batch unverified actions.

### Lesson
Even with hardcoded coordinates, ALWAYS verify each interaction took effect before proceeding. DaVinci Resolve may not register clicks/drags if timing, focus, or position is slightly off.

## CST Node Creation — LESSON LEARNED

**NEVER use MODE=both.** Always run in two steps:
1. `MODE=in` → resets nodes, creates 1 node (CST-In)
2. `MODE=out` → adds CST-Out, now 2 nodes total

Do NOT check node count between steps. Do NOT re-run if script reports success.
Trust script logs over vision analysis for node counts.
